Hello,

So as it stands now, we have our code divided into to different files.  One file, named Node, contains all the graph information.  A method is present that generates the graph based on a CSV file of campus (which we made by hand using google maps and the provided outline), along with a list of the parking lots, exits, and an adjacency list.  The supporting classes, such as the vertex, edge, and parkingLot are all present in this file as well. In addition, the work request class, which represents the movement of traffic from one road to another, is present in this file.  

In the main file, traffic.py, the actualy modeling method is present.  Here, the simulation process is effectively split up into three parts: exiting the parking lot, handling intersections, and exiting onto the highway.  We did our best to comment as much as possible to demonstrate which parts have which function.  Our heuristic functions to determine how the intersections are traversed are present at the bottom, along with other supporting methods that help the simulation run smoothly.  

All code should be full functioning, with the exception of running the exponential distribution, which was has some slight bugs.
