Hello,

So as it stands now, we have our code divided into to different files.  One file, named Node, contains all the graph information.  A method is present that generates the graph based on a CSV file of campus (which we made by hand using google maps and the provided outline), along with a list of the parking lots, exits, and an adjacency list.  The supporting classes, such as the vertex, edge, and parkingLot are all present in this file as well. In addition, the work request class, which represents the movement of traffic from one road to another, is present in this file.  

In the main file, traffic.py, the actualy modeling method is present.  Here, the simulation process is effectively split up into three parts: exiting the parking lot, handling intersections, and exiting onto the highway.  We did our best to comment as much as possible to demonstrate which parts have which function.  Our heuristic functions to determine how the intersections are traversed are present at the bottom, along with other supporting methods that help the simulation run smoothly.  

As of 11:33 PM EST, the modeling method when ran with the greedy heuristic, which represents the behavior at intersections with no officers, seems to be fully functioning.  It takes roughly 5 minutes to run, and the algorithm indicates that it takes roughly 5 hours to vacate campus.  The officer heuristic, however, is not quite free of bugs.  There are a few python syntax related bugs which we haven't quite ironed out, but the core structure will not be changed.  Hopefully the next 30 minutes will yield enough time to fix these issues as well.  One final note is that we ended up not using SimPy, and instead built the model from the ground up.
