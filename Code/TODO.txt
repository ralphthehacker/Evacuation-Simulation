About the model:

    A lot of the cars get stuck in the parking lots and stay there for hours. That's weird.
    Also, several streets are completely empty while others are filled up. This looks kinda alike
    to Sao Paulo traffic jams, where the main streets are 100% filled and the arterial streets are
    close to empty




What next:



-Add a data visualization module to this class or copy a data structure onto processing
-Add another algorithm?
-Write report
